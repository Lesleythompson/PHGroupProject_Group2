# PHGroupProject_Group2
This is a repository for the first Pubh 422 class project. The goal is to apply basic R programming skills to manage, analyze, and visualize real-world health data. We will import and clean the dataset, perform descriptive statistical analyses, and create clear and informative univariate visualizations to address key public health questions. Using R Markdown and GitHub collaboration, this project aims to produce a well-documented, reproducible report that interprets public health insights through statistical summaries and data visualization.
